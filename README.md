# Derek Elvis: Data Analyst Portfolio

## Who am I?
Hi! My name is Derek Elvis and I have recently graduated from the Rutgers Business School in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where I completed my degree in Business Analytics and Information Technologies. It is the same as a Management Information Systems degree. I enjoy working with data and reading it to understand the world around us. 

During my time at Rutgers, I accumulated many skills utilizing different applications in order to clean, manipulate, and visualize data to get the most out of the numbers. I have also gained experience with machine learning and data mining which can be beneficial for my role in data analytics. 

In my free time, I enjoy working with fun data sets and creating queries and dashboards to see the data up close and to have a higher understanding of complex data. 

This is an analyst portfolio where I can showcase my skills and share my projects :)

**Projects**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Global GDP forecasts
[Code](https://github.com/DerekElvis/portfolio/blob/main/TS_Final%20Project.pdf)

Goals: Forecast the countries with the top 10 GDP growth for the next five years

Applications/Skills: R studio, Forecasting, Accuracy testing, Visualization

Description: For the final project for time series modeling, I and two other analysts took data from a data source containing the GDP growths for the countries of the world. We cleaned and filtered the data to show the countries with the top 10 growth as well as the world average. We then used a training and testing set for KPSS root tests and ARIMA scores to forecast the data accurately.

Outcome: By utilizing R Studio, we were able to forecast and visualize the data correctly and by calculating the KPSS root tests, we were able to recover a numeric value for the accuracy. 


## Pokemon Pkedex
Code: [Pokemon Project.sql](Pokemon Project.sql)
Goals: To find important characteristics within the Pokedex

Applications/Skills: SQL, Data Manipulation Language, Aggregation

Description: For this little personal project, I used SQL to find answers in the data. The data was the Pokedex form Pokemon from generations 1-5 (those were the ones I played as a kid). In the data I cleaned, aggregated, and manipulated the data in order to find the answers I was looking for. Some of these answers were to see which Pokemon were the fastest, strongest, and other characteristics. 

Outcome: By writing queries in SQL, I could work the data to find the answers to my questions.
