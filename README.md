# Derek Elvis: Data Analyst Portfolio

## Who am I?
Hi! My name is Derek Elvis and I have recently graduated from the Rutgers Business School in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where I completed my degree in Business Analytics and Information Technologies. It is the same as a Management Information Systems degree. I enjoy working with data and reading it to understand the world around us. 

During my time at Rutgers, I accumulated many skills utilizing different applications in order to clean, manipulate, and visualize data to get the most out of the numbers. I have also gained experience with machine learning and data mining which can be beneficial for my role in data analytics. 

In my free time, I enjoy working with fun data sets and creating queries and dashboards to see the data up close and to have a higher understanding of complex data. 

This is an analyst portfolio where I can showcase my skills and share my projects :)

**Projects**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Global GDP forecasts
[Code](https://github.com/DerekElvis/portfolio/blob/main/TS_Final%20Project.pdf)

Goals: Forecast the countries with the top 10 GDP growth for the next five years

Applications/Skills: R studio, Forecasting, Accuracy testing, Visualization

Description: For the final project for time series modeling, I and two other analysts took data from a data source containing the GDP growths for the countries of the world. We cleaned and filtered the data to show the countries with the top 10 growth as well as the world average. We then used a training and testing set for KPSS root tests and ARIMA scores to forecast the data accurately.

Outcome: By utilizing R Studio, we were able to forecast and visualize the data correctly and by calculating the KPSS root tests, we were able to recover a numeric value for the accuracy. 


## Pokemon Pokedex
[Code](https://github.com/DerekElvis/portfolio/blob/main/Pokemon%20Project.sql)

Goals: To find important characteristics within the Pokedex

Applications/Skills: SQL, Data Manipulation Language, Aggregation

Description: For this little personal project, I used SQL to find answers in the data. The data was the Pokedex form Pokemon from generations 1-5 (those were the ones I played as a kid). In the data I cleaned, aggregated, and manipulated the data in order to find the answers I was looking for. Some of these answers were to see which Pokemon were the fastest, strongest, and other characteristics. 

Outcome: By writing queries in SQL, I could work the data to find the answers to my questions. 

## Stock Market school project
[Code](https://github.com/DerekElvis/portfolio/blob/main/Project%20Script%20copy.sql)

Goals: To find company financial information for nine large companies on the NASDAQ.

Applications/Skills: SQL, Data Manipulation Language, Data Definition Language, Aggregation, Joining.

Description: For my final project for my Business Data Management class, I took nine companies that are on the NASDAQ tickets and utilized SQL to find financial data for these companies. These companies are Amazon, Apple, Cisco, Meta, Mircosoft, Netflix, Qualcomm, Starbucks, and Tesla. I created and manipulated copious amounts of ticker data to clean and perform the queries. 

Outcome: By cleaning the data and providing the queries, I was able to work out the financial data for these nine companies.

## NCAA Football Dynasty Stats
[Code](https://github.com/DerekElvis/portfolio/blob/main/Football_Project.sql)

Goals: Find performance metrics for players during my four-year dynasty in NCAA 25

Applications/Skills: MySQL, Inner Joins, DML

Description: This is a project that I used during my time playing dynasty mode in NCAA 25. This game is like Madden but for college football and Dynasty allowed me to play as a coach. During my tenure, I played through four seasons as the Coastal Carolina Chanticleers and recorded stats for passing, rushing, receptions, and defence. I then took these stats into MySQL and created queries in order to find performance metrics and potential trends. 

Outcome: Using MySQL, I was able to create performance metrics such as passing yards per player, rushing-to-passing ratio, and defense stats that showed some trends. When I kept using only one quarterback and had players that had played for at least two years, I saw a significant improvement in winning percentage.
