# Derek Elvis: Data Analyst Portfolio

## Who am I
Hi! My name is Derek Elvis and I have recently graduated from the Rutgers Business School in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where I completed my degree in Business Analytics and Information Technologies. It is the same as a Management Information Systems degree. I enjoy working with data and reading it to understand the world around us. 

During my time at Rutgers, I accumulated many skills utilizing different applications in order to clean, manipulate, and visualize data to get the most out of the numbers. I have also gained experience with machine learning and data mining which can be beneficial for my role in data analytics. 

In my free time, I enjoy working with fun data sets and creating queries and dashboards to see the data up close and to have a higher understanding of complex data. 

This is an analyst portfolio where I can showcase my skills and share my projects :)
